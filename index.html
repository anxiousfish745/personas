        <h2>Accessible interface</h2>
        <p>I choose CVS self-checkout as the observed accessible interface.</p>
        <h2>Questions</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Are you a student? Please tell me a little about yourself.</li>
            <li>Have you previously used the self-checkout before? If so, how often do you use the self-checkout?</li>
            <li>Is there something that's getting you stuck in the checkout process, or is there anything you need that's hard to spot?</li>
            <li>What do you like/ dislike about the self-checkout?</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>Sketch and key interactive components</h2>

        <h3>In general, there are these four key interactive components in the interface:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The scanning prompts</li>
            <ol>
              <li>Scan the card for applicable promos and coupons</li>
              <li>Scan the items for check-out</li>
               <li>Scan the paper coupons for discounts</li>
            </ol>
            <li>The confirmations</li>
            <ol>
              <li>Confirm the scanned items on the left side</li>
              <li>Confirm whether the user wants to apply the coupon</li>
              <li>Confirm the following step</li>
            </ol> 
            <li>The payment selection</li>
            <p>Prompt the user for the final step of payment</p>
            <li>The get help button</li>
            <p>Exists in every step so that the user can get help from the staff no matter which part confuses them</p>

    <h1>P2. Recording Observations</h1>
      <h2>A few sentences or bullets describing the key observations:</h2>
      <p><b>User 1:</b></p>
      <p>Scanned the extracare card first, then scanned the purchased items. Then clicked "finish and pay," then "continue" when the machine asked them to scan the coupon.Clicked “No” for the round-up option, and chose “cash” for payment. Inserted coins and cash into the machine and get the change. Took the receipt and left.   </p>
        <ul>
          <li>No. Young professional live close to the area.</li>
          <li>Yes. I use it almost every time I visit CVS. </li>
          <li>Not really.  It is quite easy to understand once you get used to it. Sometimes it is a bit noisy though.</li>
          <li>I can skip the waiting line, which is convenient. Also avoids direct contact with other people, which makes me feel safer.</li>
        </ul>
      <p><b>User 2:</b></p>
      <p>Scanned the extracare card, then scanned the purchased items. After that clicked “finish and pay”, then scanned the paper coupons , then clicked “continue”, then clicked "finish and pay", then the system prompted if the user wanted to use the “extrabucks rewards”. Keep clicking “yes” until there is no more available, then clicked “continue”, then clicked “No” for the round-up option, and chose “credit” for payment. Inserted credit card as prompted in the pinpad, then clicked “No receipt”.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Yes. An undergrad student.</li>
          <li>Yes. It is nice and convenient.</li>
          <li>Sometimes the coupon scanning can be annoying, since some of the coupons are not applicable after being scanned. Also sometimes the machine keeps prompting the coupons and I have to click the screen multiple times. And it keeps telling me to “place the items in the bagging area”, which is super annoying. Other than that I think it works fine. </li>
          <li>It is faster than waiting in line, and also more privacy.</li>
        </ul>   
      <p><b>User 3:</b></p>
      <p>Clicked “phone number lookup”, then entered phone number. After that scanned the purchased items, clicked “finish and pay”, then continuously click “yes” to apply the coupons prompted. Clicked “continue” then clicked “No” for the round-up option, and chose “credit” for payment.  Inserted credit card as prompted in the pinpad, then clicked ”print receipt”.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Yes. Undergrad student.</li>
          <li>Yes. Not a frequent customer so maybe just once a month or so. </li>
          <li>Too many buttons so sometimes it is hard to find the one I am looking for.  (“for example?”) I just want to check out and pay as fast as possible, but there are too many options and words. I got confused because I'm not really familiar with it.</li>
          <li>As I mentioned it can sometimes be confusing. But the self-checkout is still a good option if you're in a hurry.</li>
        </ul>    
      <h2>Summarize:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The coupon-applying process is unclear and tedious.</li>
          <li>Too many options, buttons and words</li>
          <li>Inappropriate system voice prompts</li>
          <li>Confusing bagging instructions</li>
          <li>Pros: usually faster and contactless with more privacy</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>P3. Personas</h1>
    <h2>-Jesse-</h2>
    <img class="center" src="./assets/jesse.png" alt="jesse" >    
    <h4>Briefly describe the user  (1 sentence headline)</h4>
    <p>Jesse is a sophomore college student who just wants to drop by CVS after having dinner outside and on her way back to the dorm.</p>
    <h4>Point out the interface problems that your personas face. </h4>
    <p>Jesse is having trouble with the overwhelming options since she does not know how to use the coupons that is shown on the price tags. Also when she tries to put the scanned items into her backpack, the self-checkout machine keeps alarming that she should place them into the bagging area, which makes her feel really awkward.</p>
    <h4>Explain why and how a given persona represents the users of your chosen interface.</h4>
    <p>There is a large amount of young customers who just want to browse and do some random shopping in a drug store, and they do not want to spend too much time in the check out. They might not be frequent visitors, and they want to see if there are any deals. Jesse fits into this type of users who is more receptive to using self-checkout, but not familiar with the process.</p>

    <h2>-Ben-</h2>
    <img class="center" src="./assets/ben.png" alt="ben">
    <h4>Briefly describe the user  (1 sentence headline)</h4>
    <p>Ben is a young professional in his 30s. He is on his way home from gym after work, and wants to quickly grab some snacks on his way home for a live football game.</p>
    <h4>Point out the interface problems that your personas face. </h4>
    <p>Ben scans the items (two energy bars) and places them aside, and the voice loudly prompts him to place them in the bagging area, while he does not need the bags. He is also in a hurry while the interface keeps prompting selections and buttons that he does not need. </p>
    <h4>Explain why and how a given persona represents the users of your chosen interface.</h4>
    <p>There are times that users want to achieve their goals as soon as possible—for example, temporarily parking where they shouldn't have, or on their way to another thing. People in a hurry with only a few things in their cart might consider self-checkout as a good option since it eliminates the waiting line(sometimes) and small talk. Ben is this type of user—tired and in a hurry—and will get frustrated when the interface and checkout process get too complicated.</p>
